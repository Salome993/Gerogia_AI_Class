  <h1>Welcome to the Salome-Verse 🌞</h1>
  <p>A dreamer’s path from Tbilisi to Seoul — written in stars and soul.</p>

  <section>
    <p>I’m a psychology student, assistant therapist, and INFJ soul.</p>
    <p>I spend my days helping people heal through presence, empathy, and warmth. I work at a psychology center and study human emotions deeply — both in life and in books.</p>
    <p>My world is a blend of calm thoughts, soulful music, deep talks, cute notebooks, and walks with my lovely cocker spaniel 🐶.</p>

    <p>Behind the scenes, I’m learning Korean and improving my English — not just as languages, but as bridges toward a more connected and meaningful life. I’m quietly preparing for opportunities to study abroad — not only to deepen my education, but to live a life rich with culture, purpose, and heartfelt connection.</p>

    <p>I live in between words and feelings, between people’s stories and silent moments.  
    I believe in kindness, depth, and the beauty of becoming.</p>

    <h2>🎧 Music I Always Listen To</h2>
    <p>Music is a big part of my world — it helps me feel, focus, heal, and dream.  
    These are the artists and songs that stay with me, no matter what season I'm in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎙️ <strong>Michael Jackson</strong> – timeless voice, emotion, and artistry</li>
      <li>💜 <strong>BTS</strong> – their music helps me heal, feel seen, and stay strong</li>
      <li>🌸 <strong>IU</strong> – especially <em>“My Old Story”</em>, my forever favorite song</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>From gentle ballads to powerful anthems, these songs are the background to my everyday life.</em></p>

    <h2>🌱 My Goal</h2>
    <p>One day, I dream of creating my own therapy clinic — a safe, calm, and heart-centered space where I can help people heal as a psychologist.</p>
    <p>But this clinic will be more than four walls. I envision a digital sanctuary, where therapy meets technology — so I can guide, listen, and support people no matter where they are in the world.</p>
    <p>Through empathy, innovation, and deep connection, I hope to bring comfort and transformation to those navigating the emotional noise of the digital age.</p>
